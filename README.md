# Machine Learning Fairness and Explainability in Stage-Specific Cancer Survivability Prediction

This project develops machine learning (ML) models to predict cancer survivability with a focus on fairness and explainability, using data from the SEER program. It addresses the need for tailored predictions that consider the different stages of cancer, particularly bladder, breast, and prostate cancers.

## Installation

To set up this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pitthexai/ML_Fairness_Explainability_Cancer_Survivability.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
(TODO)

## Features
***Fairness Integration***: Applies fairness algorithms to ensure unbiased predictions across different patient demographics. <br>
***Explainability Tools***: Utilizes SHAP and LIME to provide insights into the decision-making process of the models. <br>
***Stage-Specific Predictions***: Trains separate models for different cancer stages to enhance prediction accuracy.
